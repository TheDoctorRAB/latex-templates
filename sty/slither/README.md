# Slither-LaTeX-package

This LaTeX Package allows you to include Python code and Serpent input files in nice looking code blocks in your documents. It's a simple package and the documentation is in a .tex/.pdf inside . It includes some example code for display purposes. If you are exceptionally interested in the simplest possible Brayton Cycle I guess go ahead and steal HeliumCycle.py.

This package is a modification of the PythonHighlight package. Sam Root (GitHub.com/sjroot97) modified the package to fit the aesthetics of Bob Borrelli's (GitHub.com/TheDoctorRAB), and extended to also include Serpent input files.

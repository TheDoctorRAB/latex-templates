# Reviewer response

Use this template to respond to reviewer comments.  

Cross referencing the manuscript with the review document is set up through the xr package.  
See comments in the tex file. 

Allow to set up a \labeltext{Comment}{label} in the review document and then just \ref{label} in the manuscript.

The label can be used in a footnote or todonotes, etc.

# Journal papers
## Standard documents

If a journal does not have a tex file provided, these documents are in a basic format for manuscript submission to just about any journal. 

These work with any of the bst files in the bst/ folder

The journal paper template is set up for submission of an original or marked (revised) manuscript. Some options are commented out to toggle; e.g., a header for the marked manuscript.

The other files are named accordingly and should be self-explanatory.

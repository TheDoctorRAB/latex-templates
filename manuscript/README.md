# Journal papers
## Standard documents

If a journal does not have a tex file provided, these documents are in a basic format for manuscript submission to just about any journal. 

The journal paper template is set up for submission of an original or marked (revised) manuscript. Some options are commented out to toggle; e.g., a header for the marked manuscript.

The other files are named accordingly and should be self-explanatory.

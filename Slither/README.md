# Slither-LaTeX-package

This LaTeX Package allows you to include Python code and Serpent input files in nice looking code blocks in your documents. It's a simple package and the documentation is in a .tex/.pdf inside . It includes some example code for display purposes. If you are exceptionally interested in the simplest possible Brayton Cycle I guess go ahead and steal HeliumCycle.py.
